    <h3>About Me</h3>
    
    <P>Hello everyone, My name is Arturo A. Soto Jimenez. I was a young man from the hood that wanted to become an EVENT PLANNER and now I’m an Event Planner and also a business owner I’m not big now but through HIM (GOD) who knows where he’s going to take me. I’ve also been set off track for some time, but now I’m finding my way back to where GOD wants me to go in this life.
<br>
<br>
      The Lord my God helped me when no one else WOULD. HE didn’t put me on this earth to stay quiet about His LOVE toward us, but He did put me on this earth to share his GRACE, MERCY, JOY, PEACE, LOVE, and GLORY.</P>
